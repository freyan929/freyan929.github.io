Welcome!!! You've made it to this tucked away corner of the Internet about me, Freya.

`2022-09-18-TODAY.MARKUP`

The above date was the first time I started out with a CS class, while I was in high school. And after that, I kept searching for more ways to develop my coding skills. Tons of failed personal projects, small club initiatives, and online certificates. Becoming a part of the CS community @ Georgia Tech in 2021, I found so much room to grow. Dedicating whole weekends to participating in or planning hackathons, attending tech talks, joining organizations for Women in Computing, learning fundamental web development and cybersecurity skills, performing research related to computer vision, and more.

To put it concisely:

{% highlight python %}
def inShort():
  print("I think coding is pretty cool")
{% endhighlight %}

As I prepare to graduate in May 2025 as a CS major with a planned minor in Economics, my goal is to work as a full stack software engineer, focusing on FinTech. 

As you could probably guess, being a college student takes up quite a bit of my day. Then all the rest of the time I'm probably trying new foods, making heishi bracelets, or [taking amateur photos][vsco-link].
